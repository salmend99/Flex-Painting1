- Mondrian Aesthetic: Employs the characteristic features of Mondrian's neoplasticism: black lines, rectangular grids, and a restricted palette of primary colors plus white.
- Customizable Grid: The underlying grid structure can be easily adjusted to control the complexity and density of the generated painting. (If applicable, mention how users can modify parameters).
